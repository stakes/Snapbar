# Snapbar

Your last 5 screenshots in your macOS menu bar.

Snapbar's always watching for when you take screenshots. It helps keep your Desktop nice and tidy by squirreling them away for you and making it easy to grab then from the menu bar to do things with them. It has a quiet but firm opinion that most of us really only need the last one or two screenshots we took anyway, so it only keeps the last five around and gets rid of all the older ones.
